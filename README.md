# Pitching Report

This app allows the user to select a MLB Pitcher from the 2023 Regular Season to quickly and easily see individual pitch metrics and location outcomes.

By implementing the `gridlayout` package, a user selects a Pitcher and which way the Batter is standing before pressing "Create Visual" to see the results.

The page includes:
- Pitch Locations
- Pitches with 2 Strikes
- Pitches that were swung on and missed
- Pitches that were hit in play
- Induced Vertical Break vs. Horizontal Break
- Release Point
- Pitch Summary Metrics
